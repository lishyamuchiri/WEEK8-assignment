# Library Management System (MySQL)

## 📖 Description  
A **relational database** for managing library operations, including:  
✔ Book catalog  
✔ Member registrations  
✔ Loan tracking  
✔ Fines for overdue books  
✔ Reservations  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Tables**: `members`, `books`, `loans`, `fines`, `reservations`  
- **Constraints**: Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`  
- **Relationships**: 1-to-Many (e.g., Member → Loans), Many-to-Many (via junction tables)  

## 🛠 How to Run  
### Method 1: MySQL Command Line  
```sh
mysql -u [username] -p library_db < library_management.sql
```

### Method 2: MySQL Workbench  
1. Open the `.sql` file in MySQL Workbench.  
2. Execute all statements (Ctrl+Shift+Enter).

## 📜 SQL File Highlights  
```sql
-- Example: Creating the 'books' table
CREATE TABLE books (
    book_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    isbn VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL  -- Ensures no duplicate ISBNs
);
```

## 📝 Notes  
- Replace placeholder values (e.g., `[username]`) with your MySQL credentials.  
- For M:N relationships (e.g., books-authors), additional junction tables are recommended.

### Key Additions:
1. **ER Diagram Link**: Replace `er_diagram.png` with your actual diagram (export as PNG/SVG).  
2. **SQL Highlight**: Added a code snippet to showcase constraints.  
3. **Setup Clarity**: Two methods for running the SQL file.
